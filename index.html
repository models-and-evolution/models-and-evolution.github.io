                                <p>Model artifacts are subject to constant evolution throughout the lifecycle of sys-
                                    tems. The evolutionary pressure emerges from various technical and business
                                    factors throughout the overall software/system engineering endeavor. Pertinent
                                    examples of such factors include changing requirements, changing environment,
                                    and changing user base, all of which give rise to unique evolutionary challenges in
                                    various system artifacts from architecture to implementation, and even in infor-
                                    mal artifacts, such as documentation. These challenges, if left unmanaged, may
                                    lead to deteriorating quality attributes, and in severe cases inconsistent artifacts
                                    or even incorrect artifacts, preventing the system from operating as intended.
                                    Therefore, proper support for efficient and effective evolution is required.
                                    The Models and Evolution workshop promotes novel theories, techniques, and
                                    tools to support evolution. To this end, the workshop brings together researchers
                                    and practitioners to discuss the latest developments on the topic.

                                    <p>The oldest continuously used and evolved domain-specific modelling language among MetaEdit+ customers is currently in its 30th year. In all that time, none of its many hundreds of users has ever had to manually edit a model file to solve a co-evolution issue. What is the reason, and is it possible to make a research career based on it? We will look at the evolutionary pressures that drive modeling language, modeling tool, and language workbench evolution. How do they differ between academia and industry, and are those differences necessary or useful? And finally, why is no co-evolution often the best form of evolution? Our hunt for answers will take us from Beijing to San Diego, from the Arctic Circle to Cape Town, before landing fully carbon-compensated back in Linz.</p>
