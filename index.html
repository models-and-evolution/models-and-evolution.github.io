                                <p>Model artifacts are subject to constant evolution throughout the lifecycle of sys-
                                    tems. The evolutionary pressure emerges from various technical and business
                                    factors throughout the overall software/system engineering endeavor. Pertinent
                                    examples of such factors include changing requirements, changing environment,
                                    and changing user base, all of which give rise to unique evolutionary challenges in
                                    various system artifacts from architecture to implementation, and even in infor-
                                    mal artifacts, such as documentation. These challenges, if left unmanaged, may
                                    lead to deteriorating quality attributes, and in severe cases inconsistent artifacts
                                    or even incorrect artifacts, preventing the system from operating as intended.
                                    Therefore, proper support for efficient and effective evolution is required.
                                    The Models and Evolution workshop promotes novel theories, techniques, and
                                    tools to support evolution. To this end, the workshop brings together researchers
                                    and practitioners to discuss the latest developments on the topic.
