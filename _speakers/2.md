  title: Towards Rapid Design of Compartmental Models
  abstract: In times of crisis, epidemiologists can come under great pressure to model rapidly evolving diseases and to produce analyses about the effects of potential public health interventions. Taking previ- ously developed, tested, and validated model components as the base on which to prototype new infectious disease models can save precious time and effort. However, there is currently no systematic process for quickly navigating a corpus of existing epidemiological models or identifying and reusing their most useful components. In this paper, we propose a vision to accelerate the creation of pro- totype compartmental models for infectious diseases. We outline a semi-automated process that epidemiologists can use to create pro- totypes that have been partially completed with reused fragments from existing models. Epidemiologists can thus focus on modelling the novel aspects of an ongoing public health crisis, as opposed to aspects of it that are already more or less well understood in previous work. Our approach comprises steps to identify useful components in a corpus of infectious disease models, generate po- tential candidate prototypes, and organize them in a formal data structure that allows navigation and exploration by the modellers. We outline the challenges ahead and discuss potential solutions based on formal modelling techniques.
