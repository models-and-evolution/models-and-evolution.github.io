  title: How and Why is Change Modeled? â€“ A Scoping Literature Review
  abstract: Models and metamodels change, entailing efforts to keep related artifacts consistent, i.e., to reflect the implications of the changes on them. In order to assess these implications, the changes or evolution steps themselves are, in most cases, of highest interest, compared to the states of the models or metamodels. While the states can be used to derive the changes, some information on the actual changes might get lost, e.g., whether an empty class has been renamed or deleted and readded. The use of deltas to describe changes is not limited to models and metamodels, but is also employed in other research areas. To get an overview of the used concepts and how they compare, we did a scoping literature review in the field of computer science, focused on modeling and related fields. We compared the different approaches in regard to how they model the change, what different dimensions they model, their ability to model atomic or composite changes, their completeness in modeling all possible changes, as well as their purpose. This overview allows for more efficient concept re-use across domains in regard to the modeling of changes and the different use cases realized with them.
