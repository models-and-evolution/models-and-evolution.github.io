  title: Building Deduplicated Model Repositories to Assess Domain-Specific Languages Evolution
  abstract: Software evolution and maintenance is a real challenge in modern software engineering. In the context of model-driven development, which heavily rely on interconnected (meta-)models, tools and generators, the evolution of both models and/or their associated meta-models is a tricky task. Such a problem also appears in language engineering, when evolving the language (its grammar, its semantic) needs to stay aligned with the existing models that already exist. In this paper, we explore how techniques inspired by repository mining can help a model designer/language engineer to build a deduplicated dataset of existing models available on open source repository. Deduplication is essential to ensure the evolution made on the metamodel/language can be efficiently assessed. We apply the method to the P4 language, an industrial domain-specific language (Intel, Linux foundation) used to model software defined network.
