  title: Towards Model-Based Decision-Telling":" Design Evolution Through Decision Nodes 
  abstract: Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) emerged as a response to the rising complexity of engineered systems, promising to reduce development times by improving consistency, collaboration, and traceability.
While MBSE is effective in consolidating design artefacts into the single source of truth (SSOT), research addressing the evolution of these models during system development remains limited.
In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a framework for capturing the evolution of MBSE models in a storytelling approach through the design decisions that drive this evolution.
Our approach adopts a recording of model evolution with version control systems and structuring decision information in natural language "Y-statements" to ensure traceability between the model's incremental development and underlying decision nodes.
