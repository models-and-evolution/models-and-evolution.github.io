  title: Keynote
  abstract: The oldest continuously used and evolved domain-specific modelling language among MetaEdit+ customers is currently in its 30th year. In all that time, none of its many hundreds of users has ever had to manually edit a model file to solve a co-evolution issue. What is the reason, and is it possible to make a research career based on it? We will look at the evolutionary pressures that drive modeling language, modeling tool, and language workbench evolution. How do they differ between academia and industry, and are those differences necessary or useful? And finally, why is no co-evolution often the best form of evolution? Our hunt for answers will take us from Beijing to San Diego, from the Arctic Circle to Cape Town, before landing fully carbon-compensated back in Linz.
