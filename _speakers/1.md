  title: The Evolutionary Life of Metamodels
  abstract: Metamodels are not static blueprints but living artifacts that evolve in step with their domains, the growing insights and awareness of their designers, and the demands of ever more ambitious requirements. As with any other software, their development is inherently iterative: abstractions are introduced, refined, and tested in cycles that call for rapid feedback.
