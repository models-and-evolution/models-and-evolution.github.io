  title: The Evolutionary Life of Metamodels
  abstract: Metamodels are not static blueprints but living artifacts that evolve in step with their domains, the growing insights and awareness of their designers, and the demands of ever more ambitious requirements. As with any other software, their development is inherently iterative: abstractions are introduced, refined, and tested in cycles that call for rapid feedback. For such an iterative process to be effective, co-evolution must be live and must not disrupt the development workflow. Yet, the moment these iterations affect dependent models, transformations, or editors, co-evolution comes into play. Despite being investigated for a long time, co-evolution still remains a difficult task, riddled with challenges such as lossless adaptation, consistency preservation, and integration into existing workflows. The complexity is heightened by the fact that not only models must be adapted but also their editors, at the bare minimum, to remain usable after metamodel changes. When co-evolution is treated as an afterthought, handled through migration scripts, ad hoc fixes, or disruptive regeneration, it breaks the modeling flow. Designers are forced to leave the creative loop, adapting tools and repairing models before resuming their actual task. This keynote explores the evolutionary life of metamodels, emphasizing the need to integrate co-evolution seamlessly into the development process. Drawing from recent advances in reflective platforms such as Jjodel, I will show how transparent, lossless, and user-guided mechanisms can transform metamodel evolution from a source of disruption into a natural driver of adaptation. By reframing evolution as an always-on capability rather than a costly intervention, we can sustain workflows that remain fluid, resilient, and accessible, whether in education, research, or industrial practice.
