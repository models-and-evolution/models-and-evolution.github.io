  title: Digital Twin Evolution for Sustainable Smart Ecosystems
  abstract:  Smart ecosystems are the drivers of modern society. They control in- frastructures of socio-techno-economic importance, ensuring their stable and sustainable operation. Smart ecosystems are governed by digital twinsâ€”real-time virtual representations of physical in- frastructure. To support the open-ended and reactive traits of smart ecosystems, digital twins need to be able to evolve in reaction to changing conditions. However, digital twin evolution is challenged by the intertwined nature of physical and software components, and their individual evolution. As a consequence, software practitioners find a substantial body of knowledge on software evolution hard to apply in digital twin evolution scenarios and a lack of knowledge on the digital twin evolution itself. The aim of this paper, conse- quently, is to provide software practitioners with tangible leads toward understanding and managing the evolutionary concerns of digital twins. Concretely, we use four distinct digital twin evolution scenarios, contextualized in a citizen energy community case to illustrate the usage of the 7R taxonomy of digital twin evolution. By that, we aim to bridge a significant gap in leveraging software engineering practices to develop robust smart ecosystems.
