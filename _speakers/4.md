  title: YANG-APR: Towards Supporting Evolution in Model-driven Network Management Systems
  abstract:  In model-driven network ecosystems, high-level specifications such as YANG data models define APIs that engineers extend with custom code and handlers. When the model evolves, it can become misaligned with its API  implementation, which typically requires manual, costly, and error-prone realignment, highlighting the need for automated repair. This paper presents our ongoing work on an automated repair approach to resynchronize evolving YANG models with their API implementations, using a four-stage pipeline":" (i) localize compatible-vs-breaking diffs between the current and updated models, (ii) enrich each diff record with contextual information, (iii) instantiate precise transformation rules for every change, and (iv) apply those rules to generate a repaired version of the code, complete with a reviewable change log for engineer validation. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we have developed an initial prototype—YANG-APR—that targets five common model evolution scenarios":" datatype change, node rename, endpoint URL rename, endpoint removal, and endpoint addition. We illustrate the approach through two representative cases":" a breaking datatype modification and a non-breaking endpoint addition. These early results show promising potential to facilitate model-implementation coevolution, providing a foundation for continued development and broader evaluation.
